***Project README***

Welcome to our project for the course ESE 2019. The goal of the project was to create a platform where people can both create and hire people for events. The project is based on Ionic, Angular and Node.js.

Starting off:

If you want to launch the project, you'll need to have the required frameworks installed. To do so, please download Node.js first.
https://nodejs.org/
Node.js comes with npm, a package manager we can use to install both Angular and Ionic. Install them like this:

npm install -g @angular/cli).
npm install -g ionic

After this, we are ready to launch the project:
Navigate to the frontend folder and run this command:
ionic serve --open
This should open the project in your default browser.
Then, navigate to the backend folder and run this command:
npm run tsc
With this running, you're set to register, login and try out the site.
